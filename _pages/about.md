Hi! My name is Bohan Yang, a junior undergraduate in the School of the Gifted Young at USTC, China. 

I am interested in Computer Architecture and Chip Design, especially concerning DSA accelerators for complex neural networks like CNN and transformer models and in different scenarios like self-driving and robotics.

Currently, I am working as a research intern at IIIS, Tsinghua University to explore design space for the dynamic neural network using hardware and software co-design.

Also, I am doing my digital chip design and tape-out in TSMC 180nm. If interested, you can find the details of this project in my repo.

Welcome to contact me!
