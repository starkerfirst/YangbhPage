Hi! My name is Bohan Yang, a junior undergraduate at the School of the Gifted Young, USTC. 

I am interested in Computer Architecture and Chip Design, especially for domain-specific accelerators of various neural networks and in different application scenarios like LLM, self-driving and edge computing.

Currently, I am working as a research intern under the supervision of Prof. Mingyu Gao at IIIS, Tsinghua University to explore design space and construct a evaluation simulator for the dynamic neural networks using hardware and software co-design.

Also, I am designing my own digital chip in TSMC 180nm process. If interested, you can find the details of this project in my repo.

As a junior, now I am applying for a Ph.D. position in computer architecture and AI chip design.

Welcome to my website!
