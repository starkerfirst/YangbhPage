Hi! My name is Bohan Yang, a junior undergraduate in the School of the Gifted Young at USTC, China. 

I am interested in Computer Architecture and Chip Design, especially concerning domain-specific accelerators for complex neural networks like CNN and Transformer models and in different scenarios like self-driving and edge computing.

Currently, I am working as a research intern under the supervision of Prof. Mingyu Gao at IIIS, Tsinghua University to explore design space and construct a gem5 SimObject for the dynamic neural network using hardware and software co-design.

Also, I am doing my digital chip design and tape-out in TSMC 180nm process. If interested, you can find the details of this project in my repo.

As a junior, now I am pursuing a Ph.D. position in computer architecture or AI chip design.

Welcome to contact me!
