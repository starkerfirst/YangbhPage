### Senior Undergraduate

*School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)*

I am a senior undergraduate majoring in physical electronics. Now I am pursuing a B.S. degree in applied physics from USTC. My interests lie in **Computer Architecture and Chip Design**, especially for domain-specific accelerators of DNN workloads and in different application scenarios like LLM and self-driving.

Currently, I am working as a research intern under the supervision of Prof. Mingyu Gao at IIIS, Tsinghua University to explore design space and construct an evaluation simulator for dynamic neural networks using hardware and software co-design.

Also, I am designing my own digital chip in TSMC 180nm process. If interested, you can find the details of this project in my repo.

Welcome to my website!
