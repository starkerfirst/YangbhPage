### Senior Undergraduate

*School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)*

I am a senior undergraduate majoring in physical electronics. My interests are across the software and hardware stack, i.e. **Computer Architecture and Chip Design**, especially for domain-specific accelerators of DNN workloads and in different application scenarios like LLM and self-driving.

Currently, I am working as a research intern under the supervision of **Prof. Fengbin Tu** at ECE, HKUST to explore design space of innovative chip architecture targeting foundation models. 

Welcome to my website!
